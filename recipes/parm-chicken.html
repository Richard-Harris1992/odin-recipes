        <li>0.25 cups butter</li>
        <li>0.25 cups chardonnay wine</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>0.75 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 dashes salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 units olive oil</li>

        <li>4 tablespoons basil</li>
    </ul>
  </p>    
  <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
  <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make brine for chicken by dissolving salt with chicken broth in a medium bowl. 
            Cover chicken breasts with plastic wrap and pound each one to about 1/2-inch thick with a kitchen mallet.
             If breasts are large, you can cut them in half.
             Add flattened chicken to the brine. 
             Cover and chill for 3 hours.</li>
        
        <li>When chicken has marinated, remove the fillets from the brine and dab with paper towels to remove excess liquid.
            Beat eggs in a medium bowl, and pour flour onto plate. 
            Combine breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper in another medium bowl. 
            To bread the chicken, first coat each fillet with flour, then egg, and then the parmesan mixture. 
            Let the breaded fillets rest for a bit on plate in your fridge while preparing the Chardonnay butter sauce.</li>

        <li>Make Chardonnay butter sauce by melting butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
            Add wine and simmer for 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice, sugar, and salt, and then add cream. 
            Simmer over low heat for 10 to 12 minutes, until thicker.</li>

        <li>Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large sauté pan, and heat over medium/low until hot. 
            You can check the heat of the oil by dripping a breadcrumb into it. 
            If it starts to sizzle, your oil is ready. 
            Sauté each breaded chicken fillet in the oil for 4 or 5 minutes per side or until brown.
            Remove fillets to a paper towel-covered plate until ready to serve.</li>

        <li>Serve each fillet with a couple tablespoons of butter sauce spooned over the top. 
            Pile a tablespoon of parmesan cheese on top of each fillet, followed by 1 heaping teaspoon of minced sundried tomatoes, and a tablespoon of basil.</li>
    </ol>
